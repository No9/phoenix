![phoenix](phoenix.png) **It's distributed!**

Social feeds without ads or owners. Be free!

Phoenix is a peer-to-peer network. It uses crytographic keypairs to create feeds and publish unforgeable entries which can spread across the network (see [secure-scuttlebutt](https://github.com/dominictarr/secure-scuttlebutt)). Bot users aggregate and redistribute the feeds.

Join us in #scuttlebutt on freenode.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The fastest way to get started is to check the issues board. Issues tagged "Help Wanted" are the low-hanging fruit and should be easy to handle. Submit your update as a PR; maintainers will review and merge asap.

Make sure your submissions are licensed for free use. All code in Phoenix (including contributions) falls under the license below, or under the licenses attached to included libraries.
